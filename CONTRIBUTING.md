# True Git Code Churn Contribution Guide
We want to make contributing to this repo as easy and transparent as possible.

So here we go, short and sweet:

1. We welcome any type of contribution(s), but any contribution(s) you make will be under the MIT software license!

2. We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). If you are not familiar with this concept, then read it through before proceeding.

3. When submitting ideas (under issues) or code changes, please consider backwards compatibility as much as possible. For example, scope a new feature as an optional argument so it does not break existing workflows for end users post upgrade.

4. Try to only include a package only when you really feel that it is absolutely necessary. True Git Code Churn is and will always intend to be very lightweight.

5. Consider the Git version and Python version when testing, it must work with Python version 3.5.3 and Git version 2.20.1 onwards.

6. When submitting a bug, try to include (1) a quick summary and/or background, (2) steps to reproduce, (3) sample code if necessary, (4) expectation(s), (5) actual finding(s), and finally (6) additional notes.
